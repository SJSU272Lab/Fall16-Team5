#Problem Statement:
How many times has it occurred that you went to a diner and couldn’t find a seat? You probably ended up spending time in long queues, ruining your dining experience and getting frustrated – not knowing that there is a diner with available seats on the next street or there was a seat available just a few minutes ago when you stopped just for a small chat.
Moreover, restaurant owners lose revenue (as well as food!) when a customer enters the diner right after the owner closed the cash counter machine. So, there is a need to develop a platform on which the consumers and the restaurant owners can communicate real-time. 

Target Audience:
@Consumers: Foodies who wish to eat at a diner in a specific location without making prior reservations.
@Owners: Restaurant owner who doesn’t want to waste food and have seats in their restaurant when nearby restaurant is full.

Proposed Solution:
@Consumers: Foodies can now look up in the app and see if there is a seat available at the location where they want to eat. They can submit the request to book the seat, and the app will give them a time-limit to reach to the restaurant. If they reach the restaurant in the specified time, the owner can check-in them and mark their seat as booked. As soon as the owner marks the seat as booked, it will be reflected across all the apps in real time.
@Owners: Owners will get a notification via ML algorithm one-hour prior to closing time to send tweets/messages to the foodies based on the historical data accumulated by the app. Owner can then decide whether to call it a day & go home or to send the tweets to the foodie popped-out by the ML algorithm. Owners also get to disapprove the request for booking in case a favorite customer comes in before the ones who booked the seat via the app.

Future Scope:
Wider ML integration to suggest appropriate restaurants to the foodies based on their eating habits, and to suggest owners what food to prepare and how much in case a customer has booked a seat. With much data (real and accurate), we can scale the app to release APIs which can be used to develop other apps (or can also expand this app) and give recommendations of available seat based on time/season to the users.

Benefits:
•	Increased revenue of the restaurant owners by allowing them to contact *prospective* customers thereby allowing them to fill up the seats at the last moment.
•	Reduced food wastage by making the restaurants aware about the eating habits of the prospective customers.
•	Lots and lots of happiness to the Foodies!
